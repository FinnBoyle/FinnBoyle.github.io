                    <p>Hi, I'm Finn Boyle, and this tab of the website is about me as a person outside of work and uni. I'll give a quick rundown of the thing I enjoy :)</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I'm a keen skier, having skied for as long as I can remember. I try to make it out to Snowplanet semi-regularly, but the real fun is on the mountains!<br>
                        As of 2022 I have visited Mt. Ruapehu, Coronet Peak and Cardrona. I'm also a member of a club in the Mt. Ruapehu area. I'd love to visit more mountains, and skiing in another country is a bucket list item.</li>
                        <li>I'm an avid reader, mostly fantasy stuff but I occasionally branch out. My favourites include all of Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere works, and Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time. If you have a recommendation though, I'd love to get more reading material!</li>
                        <li>Video games have always been a big part of my life, and that hasn't changed much over time. Some of my favourite games are Control, Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, Alan Wake, Enter The Gungeon and (formerly) Overwatch.</li>
                        <li>Tattoos have been a point of interest for me for some time, and I got my first one in September 2022 and a second in early 2024. I would love to get more.</li>
