                            <b>Final Year Industrial Project (2023)</b><br>
                            This project involved researching if and how developers
                            can benefit from the use of GPT AI models. I developed
                            controllers for a model windmill with another student
                             â€” using a range of methods, from completely manually
                            coded, to using ChatGPT to code the controllers by itself.
                            The codebase was written in TypeScript and C++.
                            This project was supervised by Roopak Sinha, Deputy Head
                            of School for Engineering, Computer and Mathematical
                            Sciences at AUT.<br><br>

                            This project involved making a game of Battleship in which
                            players would be able to play against an AI opponent.
                            While it is a simple AI, it provides some difficulty as an
                            opponent.<br><br>

                            For this project, I learned to use Figma, and designed
                            and developed a relatively simple frontend UI for Android
                            devices, intended for use in a ski resort mapping app.<br><br>

                            As part of a team of five, I worked to make a short, twolevel first-person platforming game using Unreal Engine 5
                            blueprints. I was tasked with development of the game's
                            traps (spike traps, sticky traps and bounce pads).<br><br>

                            Various websites and Java programs, usually booking
                            systems and proofs of understanding. Some involved use
                            of PHP and SQL also.<br><br>

                            <b>8x8 LED Arduino Sign with Customisable Text (2023)</b><br>
                            Using an Arduino Uno, three buttons and an 8x8 LED Matrix, I built an LED sign that can be customised.
                            Buttons act as a confirm button, a move-left button and a move-right button.
                            pressing move-left or move-right increments or decrements the currently selected list position.
                            The list consists of the alphabet, numericals and a space, plus a final confirmation choice.
                            Use the confirmation button to add the displayed alphanumeric to the display list, once finished, 
                            navigate to the end of the list and select the tick to display.
                            In display mode, the system will move through the list of chosen letters, displaying each one, 
                            one at a time on repeat until the confirmation button is pressed again, where the system resets to the selection mode.<br><br>
