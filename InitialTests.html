                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Finn Boyle, and I have been studying Software Engineering at AUT for the past five years.
                    
                    Some projects I have worked on are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>This website! :)</li>
                        <li>Synthesising Controllers for Safety-Critical Systems using GPT models</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is my final year industrial project, using ChatGPT (and potentially other GPT models) to generate code that can assist in controlling systems. 
                                I am in a team with one other student under supervision by a member of AUT staff.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>A short demo video game</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Also a team project (with four others). I created a small selection of simple traps using Unreal Engine 5 blueprints.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Various Java projects, such as booking systems</li>
                        <li>Various SQL projects, such as booking systems</li>
                        <li>A few HTML projects, one being a taxi booking system</li>
                    </ol>

                    Throughout my studies, I have gained some experience in:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Java</li>
                        <li>C++</li>
                        <li>HTML</li>
                        <li>CSS</li>
                        <li>php</li>
                        <li>JavaScript</li>
                        <li>Unreal Engine 5 blueprints</li>
                        <li>SQL</li>
                    </ol>
