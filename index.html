                        Hello! Welcome to my website! My name is Finn Boyle.<br>
                        Here, you will be able to find out about my professional work history, my education, and a little about me as a person.<br><br>

                        If you wish to contact me, feel free to send me an E-mail or message me on LinkedIn. You can also find my phone number on my CV in the Contacts page, however I would prefer you E-mail or message first.<br><br>

                        This website is intended to serve as a proof of skill and willingness to learn, and is a platform where you can view my accomplishments.<br>
                        I'll be trying to keep it up to date, but it may not always be a priority.
                    </p>
