                    <h1>Summary:</h1>
                    <p>I've spent the last five years studying Software Engineering at AUT in a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours). Throughout that time, I've been introduced to and learned many things, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Multiple coding languages, listed in no particular order:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HTML</li>
                            <li>CSS</li>
                            <li>PHP</li>

                            <li>And limited amounts of JavaScript and MATLAB</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>SQL</li>
                        <li>Android device development with Figma</li>
                        <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
                        <li>Arduinos and Raspberry Pis</li>
                        <li>Some engineering management methods and ways of working.</li>
                        <li>Human Computer Iteraction theory and how people interact with technology.</li>
                        <li>How to work in groups, in and outside of software development.</li>
                        <li>Version control!</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1>Projects:</h1>
                    <p>Throughout my time at AUT, I completed many projects. Some of these include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Final Year Industrial Project (2023)</b><br>
                            This project involved researching if and how developers
                            can benefit from the use of GPT AI models. I developed
                            controllers for a model windmill with another student
                             â€” using a range of methods, from completely manually
                            coded, to using ChatGPT to code the controllers by itself.
                            The codebase was written in TypeScript and C++.
                            This project was supervised by Roopak Sinha, Deputy Head
                            of School for Engineering, Computer and Mathematical
                            Sciences at AUT.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Python Battleship game versus an AI (2023)</b><br>
                            This project involved making a game of Battleship in which
                            players would be able to play against an AI opponent.
                            While it is a simple AI, it provides some difficulty as an
                            opponent.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Android Device Frontend Development (Using Figma) (2022)</b><br>
                            For this project, I learned to use Figma, and designed
                            and developed a relatively simple frontend UI for Android
                            devices, intended for use in a ski resort mapping app.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Unreal Engine 5 Game (2022)</b><br>
                            As part of a team of five, I worked to make a short, twolevel first-person platforming game using Unreal Engine 5
                            blueprints. I was tasked with development of the game's
                            traps (spike traps, sticky traps and bounce pads).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Other Projects (2019 - 2023)</b><br>
                            Various websites and Java programs, usually booking
                            systems and proofs of understanding. Some involved use
                            of PHP and SQL also.
                        </li>
